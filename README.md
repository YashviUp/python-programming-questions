The type of each question is given below:\
1. **Data types** - basic operations on datatypes *(str -> f-string, title(), list->indexing, int-> //, %)* and not used loops. input outputs are handled by a driver code.\
2. **Data Processing**  -  basic data processing patterns like *mapping, filtering*. input handled by driver code\
3. **Data Processing I/O** - inputs from the stdin and print the output to stdout in the specified format (list of dictionaries).\
4. **Problem-solving** - An input output based problem-solving which involves **something different from basic data processing patterns.** (good diffcultly)\
