The type of each question is given below:

2. **Data Processing**  -  basic data processing patterns like *mapping, filtering*. input handled by driver code
3. **Data Processing I/O** - inputs from the stdin and print the output to stdout in the specified format (list of dictionaries).
4. **Problem-solving** - An input output based problem-solving which involves **something different from basic data processing patterns.** (good diffcultly maybe OPPE 2 level)
